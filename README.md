# MSDS-Tech-Orientation

Welcome to the repository for the Technical Orientation of my Master's Program at the University of Virginia. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to the courses I'll be taking and the foundational skills required to succeed in the program. It will include resources, exercises, and notes that will be instrumental throughout my studies.

## Overview
This repository is designed to facilitate the transition into the Master's Program at the University of Virginia, focusing on data science, machine learning, and computer science. The content provided will help reinforce the knowledge gained during the technical orientation and the subsequent courses.

## Courses

#### Linear Models for Data Science
An introduction to linear statistical models in the context of data science. Topics include simple, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and generalized linear models. The primary software is R. Data wrangling in R will also be covered.

#### Programming for Data Science
An introduction to essential programming concepts, structures, and techniques. Students will gain confidence in not only reading code, but also learning what it means to write good quality code. Additionally, essential and complementary topics are taught, such as testing and debugging, exception handling, and an introduction to visualization. This course is project based, consisting of a semester project and final project presentations.

#### Statistical Learning
This course covers fundamentals of data mining and machine learning within a common statistical framework. Topics include regression, classification, clustering, resampling, regularization, tree-based methods, ensembles, boosting, and Support Vector Machines. Coursework is conducted in the R programming language.

#### Practice and Application of Data Science
This course covers data science practice, including communication, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. Also covered are the selection of algorithms to suit the problem to be solved, user needs, and data. Case studies will explore the impact of data science across different domains.

#### Bayesian Machine Learning
Bayesian inferential methods provide a foundation for machine learning under conditions of uncertainty. Bayesian machine learning techniques can help us to more effectively address the limits to our understanding of world problems. This class covers the major related techniques, including Bayesian inference, conjugate prior probabilities, naive Bayes classifiers, expectation maximization, Markov chain monte carlo, and variational inference.

#### Foundations of Computer Science
Provide a foundation in discrete mathematics, data structures, algorithmic design and implementation, computational complexity, parallel computing, and data integrity and consistency for non-CS, non-CpE students. Case studies and exercises will be drawn from real-world examples (e.g., bioinformatics, public health, marketing, and security).

#### Deep Learning
A graduate-level course on deep learning fundamentals and applications with emphasis on their broad applicability to problems across a range of disciplines. Topics include regularization, optimization, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, generative learning, instance-based learning, and deep reinforcement learning. Students will complete several substantive programming assignments.

#### Ethics of Big Data
This course examines the ethical issues arising around big data and provides frameworks, context, concepts, and theories to help students think through and deal with the issues as they encounter them in their professional lives.

#### Two Elective Choices
Students in the M.S. Data Science program will complete two electives during the program. Elective availability varies by term, but have historically included courses such as Exploratory Text Analytics, Big Data Systems, Data Engineering, Business Analytics for Data Scientists, and Data Visualization.

#### Capstone Project
Online M.S. in Data Science students are required to complete a capstone project. Capstone projects challenge students to acquire and analyze data to solve real-world problems. Project teams consist of two to four students and a faculty advisor. Teams select their capstone project in term 4 and work on the project in term 5, which is their final term.

Most projects are sponsored by an organization—academic, commercial, non-profit, and government—seeking valuable recommendations to address strategic and operational issues. Depending on the needs of the sponsor, teams may develop web-based applications that can support ongoing decision-making. The capstone project concludes with a paper and presentation
